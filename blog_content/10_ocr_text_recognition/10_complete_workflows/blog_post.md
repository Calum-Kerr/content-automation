# Combining OCR with PDF Editing for Complete Workflows

OCR technology transforms static document images into searchable, editable text, but this is often just the first step in a comprehensive document workflow. By combining OCR with PDF editing capabilities, users can create end-to-end solutions that not only recognise text but also enhance, modify, and finalise documents for specific business or personal needs. This integrated approach creates more efficient, effective document processes that deliver greater value than either technology alone.

This comprehensive guide explores strategies and best practices for combining OCR with PDF editing to create complete document workflows, helping you implement solutions that transform, improve, and finalise documents in a seamless process.
