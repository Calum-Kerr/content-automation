# OCR and Searchable PDFs: Making Archives Discoverable

Archives and document repositories contain vast amounts of valuable information, but when stored as image-based files or scanned documents, this information remains effectively locked awayâ€”visible but not searchable, readable but not findable. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology transforms these hidden archives into discoverable resources by converting image-based text into searchable content while preserving the original document appearance.

This comprehensive guide explores how OCR and searchable PDFs can revolutionise document archives, making them not just digitally preserved but truly accessible, searchable, and usable for research, business, and knowledge management.

## The Challenge of Image-Only Archives

Before diving into solutions, let's understand the limitations of non-searchable archives:

### Limitations of Image-Based Documents

1. **Search and Discovery Barriers**:
   - Text content invisible to search engines
   - Inability to find specific information
   - Manual browsing as the only access method
   - Keyword and concept searching impossible
   - Hidden information and connections

2. **Accessibility Challenges**:
   - Screen reader incompatibility
   - Text-to-speech functionality unavailable
   - Difficult access for visually impaired users
   - Text size adjustment limitations
   - Assistive technology barriers

3. **Utilisation Restrictions**:
   - Text cannot be copied or extracted
   - Content cannot be repurposed
   - Data cannot be analysed or mined
