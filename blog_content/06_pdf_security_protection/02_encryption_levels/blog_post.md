   - The file encryption key is itself encrypted using the user or owner password
   - Different encryption algorithms determine how this process occurs
   - The encrypted document can only be accessed with proper credentials

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Encryption Algorithm**: Mathematical process used to scramble content
   - **Key Length**: Determines strength of encryption (measured in bits)
   - **User Password**: Controls who can open the document
   - **Owner Password**: Controls permissions and restrictions

3. **Security Dictionary**:
   - Special section in the PDF file that stores security settings
   - Contains information about encryption method used
   - Stores permission settings
   - Includes encrypted keys and other security parameters
