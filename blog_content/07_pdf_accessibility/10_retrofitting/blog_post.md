# Retrofitting Existing PDFs for Accessibility

Many organizations face a common challenge: a large library of existing PDF documents that were created without accessibility in mind. These legacy PDFs—which may include important publications, forms, reports, and other materials—often present significant barriers to users with disabilities. Retrofitting these documents for accessibility is essential for ensuring equal access to information, meeting legal requirements, and maintaining organizational reputation.

This comprehensive guide explores strategies, techniques, and tools for efficiently retrofitting existing PDF documents to meet accessibility standards, from assessment and prioritization to specific remediation approaches for different document types.

## Understanding the Retrofitting Challenge

Before diving into specific techniques, let's understand the scope of the challenge:

### Common Accessibility Issues in Existing PDFs

Typical problems found in legacy documents:

1. **Structural Problems**:
   - Missing or incomplete document tags
   - Improper reading order
   - Lack of heading structure
   - Untagged tables and lists
   - Inaccessible form fields

2. **Content Accessibility Issues**:
   - Missing alternative text for images
   - Scanned text without OCR
   - Inaccessible charts and graphs
   - Color-dependent information
   - Poor contrast text

3. **Navigation and Usability Barriers**:
   - Lack of bookmarks
   - Missing document properties
   - Undefined document language
   - Security settings blocking accessibility
   - Lack of form field labels

### Retrofitting vs. Recreation

Deciding when to fix versus when to rebuild:

1. **When Retrofitting Makes Sense**:
   - Document is in final form
   - Source files are unavailable
   - Content is relatively simple
   - Minor to moderate issues
   - High-value, long-lifecycle documents

2. **When Recreation May Be Better**:
   - Source files are available
   - Document has extensive issues
   - Complex layouts or extensive tables
   - Scanned document with poor quality
   - Document requires substantial updates anyway

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Fix critical documents immediately
   - Recreate when updates are needed
   - Prioritize based on usage and importance
   - Consider partial recreation of complex sections
   - Balance immediate needs with long-term strategy

### Business Case for Retrofitting

Understanding the value proposition:

1. **Legal Risk Reduction**:
   - Compliance with accessibility laws
