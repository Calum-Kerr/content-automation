# PDF/UA Standard: Making Documents Universally Accessible

The PDF/UA standard (PDF/Universal Accessibility) represents the gold standard for accessible PDF documents. Officially known as ISO 14289, this international standard defines the technical requirements for creating universally accessible PDF files that can be used by people with disabilities, including those who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers, magnification software, and alternative input devices.

Unlike general accessibility guidelines, PDF/UA provides specific, technical requirements that ensure consistent accessibility across different platforms and assistive technologies. Understanding and implementing this standard is essential for organizations committed to true document accessibility.

This comprehensive guide explores the PDF/UA standard in detail, from its core requirements to implementation strategies and verification methods.
