PDFs present a more polished, professional appearance:

### 4. Security Features

PDFs offer various security options not available in Word:

### 5. Smaller File Size

PDFs often have smaller file sizes than their Word counterparts, especially for documents with many images, making them:

## Basic Methods for Converting Word to PDF

Let's explore the simplest ways to convert Word documents to PDF:

### Method 1: Using Microsoft Word
