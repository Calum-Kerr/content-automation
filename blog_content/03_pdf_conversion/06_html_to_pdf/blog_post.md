   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="print-styles.css" media="print">
   ```

2. **CSS for page breaks**:
   ```css
   /* Force page break before element */
   .page-break-before {
     page-break-before: always;
   }
   
   /* Avoid page break inside element */
   .keep-together {
     page-break-inside: avoid;
   }
   ```

3. **Hiding web-only elements**:
   ```css
   @media print {
     .navigation, .footer, .ads, .comments {
       display: none;
     }
   }
   ```

### Headers, Footers, and Page Numbers

Add professional document elements:

1. **Using CSS for running headers/footers**:
   ```css
   @page {
     @top-center {
       content: "Company Report";
     }
     @bottom-right {
       content: "Page " counter(page);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Using tool-specific options**:
   - wkhtmltopdf's `--header-html` and `--footer-html` options
   - Puppeteer's headerTemplate and footerTemplate
   - [RevisePDF](https://www.revisepdf.com)'s header/footer designer

3. **Dynamic content in headers/footers**:
   - Date and time

   - Author information
   - Page numbers and total pages

### Handling Long Content and Pagination

Manage content flow across pages:

1. **Controlling page breaks**:
   - Use CSS properties like `page-break-before`, `page-break-after`, and `page-break-inside`
   - Add explicit page break elements
   - Keep related content together

2. **Table handling**:
   - Use `table-header-group` and `table-footer-group` for repeating headers/footers
   - Control table splitting with `page-break-inside`
   - Consider breaking very large tables into multiple tables

3. **Handling very long pages**:
   - Split content into logical sections
   - Use tools that can handle pagination automatically
   - Consider generating multiple PDFs for extremely long content
