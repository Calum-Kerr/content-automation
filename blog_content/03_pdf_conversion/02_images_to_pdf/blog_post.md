#### Python Script Example:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def images_to_pdf(image_folder, output_filename):
    images = []
    for file in sorted(os.listdir(image_folder)):
        if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png')):
            image_path = os.path.join(image_folder, file)
            image = Image.open(image_path)
            # Convert to RGB if RGBA (for PNG transparency)
            if image.mode == 'RGBA':
                image = image.convert('RGB')
            images.append(image)
    
    # Save the first image as PDF with the rest appended
    if images:
        images[0].save(
            output_filename, 
            save_all=True, 
            append_images=images[1:],
            resolution=100.0
        )

# Example usage
images_to_pdf('path/to/images', 'output.pdf')
```
