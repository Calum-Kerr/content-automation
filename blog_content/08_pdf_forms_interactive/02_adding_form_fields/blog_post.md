# Adding Form Fields to Existing PDF Documents

Many organizations have existing PDF documents—like applications, contracts, surveys, or order forms—that would benefit from being converted into interactive fillable forms. Rather than recreating these documents from scratch, you can add form fields directly to your existing PDFs, preserving the original design while adding interactive functionality. This approach saves time, maintains document consistency, and allows you to leverage your established materials.

This comprehensive guide explores the process of transforming static PDF documents into interactive forms by adding various types of form fields, from basic text inputs to advanced interactive elements.
